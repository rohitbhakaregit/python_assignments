Python problem statement

Write a monitoring tool that lets us see the status of a machine at a specific point in time.

1) CPU and System load
2) Memory usage
3) Disk Usage
4) Network latency. Let suppose we will ping facebook.com at an interval of 5 seconds five times and record the min response time, average response time, and the max response time.


Combined all the above function into one file and on running the file you should result in slack/console/files.

send alerting message when the disk is above 90 on slack, and CPU is above 80 and the memory usage is above 80. "

You should use Python to solve the above problem statement. You can use Talentica's slack workspace to achieve this. You don't need to use an EC2 instance; you can simply use your local system or a VM.
